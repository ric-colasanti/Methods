                <p>The Framingham heart study followed 12,067 people repeatedly from 1971 to 2003. Analysis of the data set by Christakis and Fowler[1]]showed that a person’s chances of becoming obese increased by 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-8 bgTextBox">
                <p>There are two sociological phenomena that can explain the effect of a friend's obesity on a person:  <b>homophily</b> and the theory of <b> social influence</b>.</p>
                <p><b>Homophily</b> is where a person forms a link to another person who is like them.</p>
                <p><b>Social influence</b> is where a person becomes more like a person they are linked to.</p>
                <p> The Christakis and Fowler study shows that homophily is a strong influence because  a person’s chances of becoming obese are influenced by a friend who becomes obese. The relative strengths of homophily and social influence will be important factors in the parametrisation of the model</p>

                <p>Networks consist of nodes and edges. In the social network of the Framingham heart study described by Christakis and Fowler the nodes are the people in the study and the edges are the relationships between the people. These relationships are friends, family and coworkers. Networks are found throughout nature and society. Despite their apparent random appearance <b>network theory</b> can be applied to these networks to identify common patterns and behaviours. Using network theory, artificial networks of social interactions can be constructed that have the same important characteristics of real social networks. These artificial networks can then be used in models with the assurance that they will behave in the same way as real social networks found in society.  </p>

                <p>Giabbanelli et al[1] applied network theory to generate artificial social networks. They include a simple model of human metabolism and simulated how individuals inﬂuence each other with respect to food consumption and physical activity. They applied their model to both synthetic and real-world populations and demonstrated the importance of the structural properties of the collective social network of the individual on the macro-level distribution of body mass and obesity found in the population </p>

                As stated in the section on the Framingham heart study the relationships described by Christakis and Fowler are friends, family and coworkers. Unemployment may result in the modification of a person's network structure because of possible removal of interactions with previous co-workers. Giabbanelli et al have demonstrated the importance of the structural properties of the social network on a person's body mass and potential obesity. The aim of this project is to develop the Giabbanelli model so that we can simulate the change in energy balance and obesity influenced by the modification of social networks brought about by unemployment.

                <p>We are using Agent Based Models (ABM) in our simulations. ABM are where persons (or agents) in a society are modeled as individuals within a computer program. The behaviour of the complete system emerges from the interaction of the agents with their environment and with each other.</p>
                <p>We are writing the models in Google's Colab. Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources.This means that the model can be run by anyone with a Google account and a Chrome or Edge browser. Nothing needs to be installed on their computer.</p>
                <p>We are demonstrating the general ABM methodology we will be using with the Body Mass Unemployment model by recreating a number of key sociological ABMs. We have done this to inform our discussions and hence our plans for our main  model.We have started with the very early models 1) Schelling’s segregation model. 2) Axerod's model of the dissemination of culture.</p>

                    You have to have to be signed in to a google account. Colab does not work fully with Firefox browser use Chrome or Edge</b></p>

                <p>The economist Thomas Schelling wrote an agent based model to explore how simple rules that describe an agent's preference for housing can give rise to urban segregation. His model exhibited segregation even when individual agents didn't mind having neighbours of a different race or economic background.</p>
